# Plant Leaf Disease Detection System Using AI Algorithms

The "Plant Leaf Disease Detection System Using AI Algorithms" repository contains scripts and resources for developing a system that accurately detects diseases in plant leaves using advanced AI algorithms. This tool helps in early detection and management of plant diseases, contributing to healthier crops and increased agricultural productivity.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Utilize OpenCV for pre-processing and enhancing leaf images.
- **AI Model Training**: Train deep learning models to classify diseases based on leaf images.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface using Tkinter for easy interaction.
- **Prediction Results**: Display disease predictions with confidence scores.

## Requirements

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pycharm IDE
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- PyQt5 Designer

 
## Usage
1. Open the Pycharm IDE editor.
2. Follow the instructions to load the dataset and train the model.
3. Use the Tkinter interface to upload leaf images and get disease predictions.
